AuthlogicCas
============

AuthlogicCas is a CAS (a cross-site authentication system designed at Yale for single sign-on authentication) add-on for the Authlogic authentication system.

This extension requires the Rubycas-client plugin and a working CAS server with which it will communicate for CAS authentication.

Attention: This add-on works only with Rails!


Install
=======

1. Install the rubycas-client plugin. You can download it from here:
	http://code.google.com/p/rubycas-client/

2. Install this plugin.

3. In your config/environment.rb make sure that the rubycas-client plugin will be loaded before this plugin. You can ensure that by adding something like this to the Rails::Initializer.run block:
	config.plugins = [ :casclient, :authlogic_cas, :all ]

4. Add the rubycas-client filter settings at the end of the config/environment.rb:
	CASClient::Frameworks::Rails::Filter.configure(
	  :cas_base_url => "https://your.cas.server.here/",
	  :enable_single_sign_out => true
	)
